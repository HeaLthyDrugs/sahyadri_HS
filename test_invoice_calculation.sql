-- SQL Query to Test Invoice Calculations
-- This query replicates the same logic used in the MonthlyReport component and Invoice

-- INSTRUCTIONS:
-- 1. Replace 'YOUR-PACKAGE-UUID-HERE' with your actual package UUID
-- 2. Replace '2025-07-01' and '2025-07-31' with your actual date range
-- 3. Run each section separately to debug step by step
